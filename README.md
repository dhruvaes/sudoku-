For those who don't know it, Here's a brief description of the game:
Sudoku is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle.

The objective is to fill a grid made of 9x9 squares (81 in total) with digits
so that each column, each row, and each box* contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which may have a unique solution or several possible solutions.

The grid contians 9 so-called 'boxes', that is 3x3 sub-grids within the general grid.
